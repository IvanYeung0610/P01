DISCO:
* weather bit key is limited to 50 calls per a day
* NBA Schedule API does not require a key to be used

QCC:

Notes:
* To determine the weight of the weather, we use 75 degrees (F), 60 % humidity, and 0 % chance of rain as the 'standard', meaning 100%
    * To calculate the weight of the temperature, we use 2 separate distributions.
        * If the temperature is 75 or below, we divide the temperature by 75.
        * If the temperature is at or above 75, we take the difference of the temperature and 75 and get the inverse.
    * Humidity is the same:
        * Less than or equal 60: humidity / 60
        * More than 60: (humidity - 60) / 100
    * Rain chance is 1 - (rain chance / 100), since rain chance is expressed as a percentage

* To determine the weight of NBA games, we find the difference between the current time and the next NBA game
    * If the difference is under 30 min and at or above 0 (game is starting in less than 30 min), we subtract (difference / 30) from 1 to get the weight
    * If the difference is between -60 and 0, the weight is set to 0 (game has been going on for less than an hour)
    * If neither of these conditions are filled, the weight is set to 1

* To determine the weight of the user's favorite anime, we check 2 things: if the anime is finished airing, and if the anime will air a new episode within 30 minutes
    * Uses a the same algorithm as NBA, except it checks if the anime is finished airing. If it is, the weight is automatically set to 0.

* The weights of the three APIs are averaged, then used in a picker, which picks between going outside or not, with the calculated weight used for the weight of going outside.
