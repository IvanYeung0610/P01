          How Does the Algorithm Work?
        </h4>
          <h5 class="lead">
              To determine the weight of the weather, we use 75 degrees (F), 60 % humidity, and 0 % chance of rain as the 'standard', meaning 100%
              <ul>
                  <li>To calculate the weight of the temperature, we use 2 separate distributions.</li>
                  <li>If the temperature is 75 or below, we divide the temperature by 75.</li>
                  <li>If the temperature is at or above 75, we take the difference of the temperature and 75 and get the inverse.</li>
              </ul>
              Humidity is the same:
              <ul>
                  <li>Less than or equal 60: humidity / 60</li>
                  <li>More than 60: (humidity - 60) / 100</li>
              </ul>
              Rain chance is 1 - (rain chance / 100), since rain chance is expressed as a percentage<br>
              <br>
              To determine the weight of NBA games, we find the difference between the current time and the next NBA game
              <ul>
                  <li>If the difference is under 30 min and at or above 0 (game is starting in less than 30 min), we subtract (difference / 30) from 1 to get the weight</li>
                  <li>If the difference is between -60 and 0, the weight is set to 0 (game has been going on for less than an hour)</li>
                  <li>If neither of these conditions are filled, the weight is set to 1</li>
              </ul>
              <br>
              To determine the weight of the user's favorite anime, we check 2 things: if the anime is finished airing, and if the anime will air a new episode within 30 minutes
                  <ul>
                      <li>Uses a the same algorithm as NBA, except it checks if the anime is finished airing. If it is, the weight is automatically set to 0.</li>
                  </ul>
              <br>
              The weights of the three APIs are averaged, then used in a picker, which picks between going outside or not, with the calculated weight used for the weight of going outside.<br>
